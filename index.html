                    <p>UN Robotics is interested in providing students with experiences and opportunities that enhance their understanding of and skill set in robotics through participating in fun, yet challenging robotics activities.</p>

                    <p>This year, we hope to give meeting attendees more hands-on robotics experience through mini-lessons with CEENBots, while still participating in larger projects such as creating a camera-aiming device to go on a high-altitude balloon.</p>

                    <p>If you are a UNO/UNL student, and are interested in programming and learning more about robotics, then join us on <a href="https://orgsync.com/81625/chapter">MavSync</a> and come to our meetings!</p>
